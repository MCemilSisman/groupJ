# Project Topic: 
  Road Block

# Project Description:
Game focuses around Catching escaping theif by using police cars and blocking thiefs road to escape. Player has to position his or her police cars to zero in on suspect red car. Game requires management of limited resources with a given environment. Or as creator of original board games say "It’s your job to coordinate your squad of officers and get their patrol cars to zero in on the suspect, block his escape and arrest him!"[1].

# What we will do? and our requirements:
Gameplay of “Road Blocker: Alpha” is very simple, first the level that designed to beat by player is prepared which includes a placed red car and some building blocks as obstacles. Player have to use different blocks with police cars on it to block the placed red car’s escape towards edges of the table. Player can rotate those blocks before picking and placing them according to his needs. There will be a set of numbers of blocks according to difficulty of level. Table size may change depending on the level. Also some levels may provide 2 red cars to challenge the player.
Game mainly targets 7-15 years old as audience but in order to provide a challenge for the players who seeks challenge, game includes a score system. This way different players can play and challenge to each other to beat others scores which resembles the old school Arcade games where people have to play many times to master the game and challenge other people for fun. Of course game does not force player to beat the level in limited time but score system provides an alternative for different types of players.


# Differences from physical version:
The main difference of our game with the original one is digital additions we made to the game such as time and scorekeepers and also expendable map option which were not a thing in the physical board game.
